# Project Overview

**In this repository, I have Two Project using AWS are as follow:**


[**Frontend Deployment on AWS**](/Frontend%20Deployment%20on%20AWS/Frontend%20on%20AWS.md)


1. **AWS Infrastructure:**
   Set up EC2 instances for web servers, utilize S3 for static content, and configure Auto Scaling to manage server instances dynamically.

2. **Frontend Deployment:**
   Develop the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Host static assets in S3, configure Apache 2 on EC2 for dynamic content.

3. **Monitoring with CloudWatch:**
   Implement AWS CloudWatch for monitoring infrastructure metrics, setting up alarms to ensure performance tracking.

4. **Auto Scaling:**
   Enable Auto Scaling on EC2 instances to adjust server count based on traffic, optimizing resource utilization.

5. **Amazon SNS Integration:**
   Integrate Amazon SNS for event-driven communication, setting up topics and subscriptions for notifications and alerts.

6. **Apache 2 Configuration:**
   Configure Apache 2 on EC2 for handling HTTP requests, traffic routing, and security measures like access controls.

[Worpress Deployment on AWS](/WordPress%20Website%20on%20AWS/WordPress%20Deployment.md)

1. **AWS Infrastructure Setup:**
   Provision an EC2 instance for WordPress, an Amazon RDS instance for the database, and configure security groups and key pairs.

2. **Install and Configure WordPress:**
   Connect to the EC2 instance, install and configure WordPress using LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack. Set up the database connection with the RDS instance.

3. **Domain Configuration:**
   Assign a domain to your WordPress site using Route 53. Configure DNS settings to point to the public IP or Elastic IP of your EC2 instance.

4. **SSL/TLS Certificate:**
   Secure your site by configuring an SSL/TLS certificate using AWS Certificate Manager. Update Apache configurations to use HTTPS.

5. **Backup and Restore:**
   Implement regular backups of your WordPress site and database using AWS services like Amazon S3. Ensure you can restore in case of data loss.

6. **Auto Scaling (Optional):**
   If needed, set up Auto Scaling for the EC2 instance to handle varying traffic loads automatically.

7. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   Utilize AWS CloudWatch for monitoring server metrics. Set up alarms for critical thresholds to receive alerts in case of issues.
