# Deploy Wordpress Website on AWS

Over **30%** of all websites on the internet use WordPress as their `content management system (CMS)`. It is most often used to run blogs, but it can also be used to run **e-commerce sites**, **message boards**, and many other popular things. This guide will show you `how to set up a WordPress blog site`.

![Architecture Diagram](/WordPress%20Website%20on%20AWS/Diagram1.png)
## Overview

**As **WordPress** requires a `MySQL database` to store its `data` ,`create an RDS` as I did in Day 44.**

To configure this `WordPress site`, you will create the following resources in AWS:

- An **Amazon EC2** instance to **install and host the WordPress application.**
- An **Amazon RDS for MySQL database** to store your WordPress data.
- Setup the **server**(I used Apache Server) and post your new Wordpress app.

### AWS EC2 Instance?

- ` Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud`` (Amazon EC2) is a  `web service`` that provides **secure**, **resizable compute capacity** in the cloud. It is designed to make **web-scale** cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction.

### AWS RDS?

- `Amazon Relational Database Service` *(Amazon RDS) makes it easy to **set up**, **operate**, and **scale a relational database in the cloud**. It provides **cost-efficient** and **resizable capacity** while automating **time-consuming administration** tasks such as **hardware provisioning**, **database setup**, **patching** and \*\*bac*kups\*\*.
- It `frees` you to `focus` on your applications so you can give them the `fast performance`, `high availability`, `security` and `compatibility` they need.

### Apache Server?

- The **Apache HTTP Server**, colloquially called **Apache**, is a free and open-source **cross-platform** web server software, released under the terms of **Apache License 2.0**. Apache is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation.

### IAM Role?

- An **IAM role** is an **IAM identity** that you can create in your account that has **specific permissions**. An **IAM role** is similar to an **IAM user**, in that it is an **AWS identity** with **permission policies** that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS.

## Task-01

- **Step-01:** Let's create an `EC2 instance` for our WordPress site on AWS.Give it a name and select the `Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type` AMI.

- Now let's install **mysql-client** in our EC2 instance.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install mysql-client
```

![Screenshot from 2023-07-21 12-23-37](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/4fda8406-5a29-43bd-a1a5-bbeebc495800)

- Go to **RDS Console** > Open the `Database you created` > In the details of your Amazon RDS database, the hostname will be shown as the Endpoint in the Connectivity & Security section.

![imageedit_28_6002623661](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/928324b8-76cd-4402-bd53-f50e512d8b46)

- Here we are connecting the RDS Database with mysql-client in our EC2 instance.

```
export MYSQL_HOST=<your-endpoint>
#export MYSQL_HOST=wordpress.caxt8wmsdc7r.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com
```

![Screenshot from 2023-07-21 12-26-16](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/71c6fa55-e8f7-4210-b880-120c69797fe2)

- Now let's fill the **Master username** and **Master password** which we created while creating the RDS instance so that it verifies and give access to mysql.

```
mysql --user=<user> --password=<password> wordpress
#mysql --user=admin --password=Rohit8329$ wordpress
```

![Screenshot from 2023-07-21 12-27-23](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/69acec11-aea9-4856-b89a-90ac548e7664)

- Now let's Install a Server where we can Host our Website for that we have used **Apache Server**.

```
sudo apt update
```

![Screenshot from 2023-07-21 13-28-16](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/96d43057-a73e-4357-b427-6beff75a8c1e)

- Now let's check the status of the **apache server**.Open the **Public IP** of your `EC2 instance` in the browser.

![Screenshot from 2023-07-21 13-29-25](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/5768042a-4b0f-41cf-928b-4176d0e98bc7)

---

- Now let's create a Database of our WordPress site.

```
CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
CREATE USER 'wordpress' IDENTIFIED BY 'wordpress-pass';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'wordpress';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Exit
```

![Screenshot from 2023-07-21 13-27-43](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/22a721fe-2bf2-4188-8e7b-85608d09f87e)

- After this let's Download and COnfigure the WordPress.
- wget command is used to download the WordPress.

```
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
```

![Screenshot from 2023-07-21 13-30-52](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/a0ebc1f9-0f93-4d68-8438-7773115365e1)

- Now let's extract the tar file.

```
tar -xvzf latest.tar.gz
```

![Screenshot from 2023-07-21 13-31-21](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/682198d6-8d69-4e91-ab19-518137b5937a)

- After Extracting `change the directory` to wordpress and create a **copy** of the default `configuration file `which is **(wp-config-sample.php)**.

```
cd wordpress
cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
```

![Screenshot from 2023-07-21 13-33-56](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/cc08723c-0f94-4572-9a08-0e1599f72e2c)

- Now let's edit the **wp-config.php** file.

```
vim wp-config.php
```

- First, We will edit the **database name** and **database user** and **database password**.

![Screenshot from 2023-07-21 16-03-12](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/3d4baf98-a4cc-4081-b3ea-f088af65d3f6)

- Now let's edit the **Authentication Unique Keys and Salts**.Copy the below API code and paste it in the **wp-config.php** file.

https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/

![Screenshot from 2023-07-21 16-03-25](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/bbea546f-0e66-408d-a6e6-964d042c80ef)

- Now let's Deploy the WordPress site, but before that we need to install some dependencies.

```
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql -y
```

![Screenshot from 2023-07-21 13-37-03](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/f5358ee2-8c0c-4334-93f2-458d3e44e83b)

- Now let's copy the WordPress files to the **Apache root directory**.

```
cd ..
sudo cp -r wordpress/* /var/www/html/
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

![Screenshot from 2023-07-21 13-37-37](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/ccf9d365-935e-4ea4-867c-ed46146c02e1)

- To check the website is running or not open the **Public IP** of your `EC2 instance` in the browser.

```
http://<public-ip>/wp-admin
```

![Screenshot from 2023-07-21 13-38-36](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/54087e5f-620d-45f1-a3f5-14b51c50f035)

Thus we have successfully deployed our WordPress site and also connected it with the RDS instance.

### NOTE : After Check the website Delete Ec2 instance and RDS instance to avoid unnecessary charges.
